## C++ EXERCISES AND NOTES 
This are the exercises that i'm doing to learn **`C++`**, *(or the exercises that I did, if you're reading this in the future)*. 
Each exercise is inside the project folder, and each file contains the code and the description of the exercise, 
The precompiled headers and other "generated files" (the ones generated by the IDE, **VS 2017** in this case), can be found in the directory too, in case you want to compare your's with mine's (but really, WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT).
The code is fully commented, with as much detail as I can, and it's meant to be used for reference and/or as a 
learnig material. 

##### _Feel free use this to learn!_ **(If you are experienced with C++ and decide to check the code, if you see a mistake or bad practice, feel free to create an Issue pointing it)**
