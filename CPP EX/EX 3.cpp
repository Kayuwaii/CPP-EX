EXCERCISE 3
a) - Option 1 (Apt / Not Apt): Ask for the user's grade and say if he/she has passed or not.
b) - Option 2 (driver's license): Ask the age of the user and say if you can take the
driving or not.
c) - Option 3 (even / odd): Ask for a number and say if it is even or odd.
d) - Option 4 (divisible between 7): Ask for a number and say if divisible between 7 or not.
e) - Option 5 (triangle): Ask the 3 sides of a triangle and say if it is equilateral (the 3 sides
same
f) - Option 6 (winner): In a football match between 2 teams A and B, request the number of
goals scored by each team and say which team has won or if they have tied.

The Fellows of the Carnet Jove are all young people between 12 and 30 years old, all inclusive.
I) - Option 9 (grades): Ask for a grade and say which letter corresponds:
grade <5: I;
grade> = 5 and grade <6: S;
grade> = 6 and grade <7: B;
grade> = 7 and grade <9: N;
grade> = 9: E;
